# 👋 Hi, I'm Danila

## 👀 Skills & Knowledge
My first "real" program was written with `python 3.4`. Since that time I love this language and try to improve myself using it. Here's list of libraries and frameworks that I use in my projects:
- **Telethon** — async library for access to TelegramAPI
- **Asyncio** — stdlib for async programming in python
- **Requests** — sync http requests
- **Selenium** — automation for Chrome Driver
- **TKinter** — simple GUI for my projects
- **Base64, time, pickle** — and other small modules for projects

## 🌱 Education
> *"To become the best programmer you need to know how to code, how to solve every task with algorythms and data structures that suit well and understand how it works on low-level."*

> *Danila Smolyakov*

I always trying to improve my programming skills by different ways: learning methonds and models of programm architecture, stylecodes and documentation guides, algorythms and data structures, structure of PC and its devices (CPU, RAM, GPU and so on). Now I'm focused on:
- Basic algorythms like search and sort
- Basic data structures: linked lists, stacks, deques binary trees and others
- Architecture of GUI programms: how to separate logic and UI
